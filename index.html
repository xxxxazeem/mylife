<p><i>Short stories are self-contained works of prose fiction whose function is to impart a moral, capture a moment, or evoke a certain mood. 
Short stories are often more focused, as all the elements within—plot, character, pacing, story structure, and so on—must work together towards this common goal.</i></p>
